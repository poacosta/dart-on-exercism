# Dart rocks

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is an open source, not-for-profit project built by people from all backgrounds. With over one hundred dedicated maintainers and thousands of contributors, our goal is to create the best, free, code learning platform on the web.

**This repo contains my progress in the [Dart track](https://exercism.org/tracks/dart) on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).**

## About Dart

Dart brings object-oriented and typing together with the flexibility that JavaScript is known for. It is designed to simplify common programming tasks. In recent years, its popularity in the software development community has grown tremendously.

The primary concepts baked into the making of the language were:

* It is simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
  * The language derives its syntax from Java and JavaScript; as well as Smalltalk.
* It has a built-in concurrency model that is easy to learn and use.
* It provides tools out of the box to help development efforts.
* It has strong support via many standard libraries.
* It is architecture-neutral and portable.
* It executes with high performance for practical applications and not just benchmarks.

Dart is a very versitile language that can be used in a variety of different ways:

* Dart code can be transpiled into JavaScript for web development, typically using  AngularDart.
* Application servers can be written using Dart.
* Cross-platform mobile application development can be achieved through a popular framework called [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
* Google Firebase APIs can be integrated into Dart apps using the libraries written by the Firebase team.
  
There is a rich ecosystem springing up around Dart because the standard (built-in) libraries can be supplemented by open source libraries found on Pub.
